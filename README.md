# Plate'Em Mobile App

I, Landon Zheng, was a Software Engineer for the project Plate'Em, in which we developed a nutrition mobile app tailored specifically for UT Austin Freshman to avoid the dreaded "Freshman 15" (the 15 pounds Freshmen gain when eating at the Austin Dining Halls). 

We implemented an AI-chatbot trained on an extensive amount of health record databases to give users personalized meals that would fit their unique health goals. The users were able to chat with the AI and ask for different meal recommendations as well. These meal recommendations were fetched straight from the J2 Dining Menu Website daily.

Additionally, the app was able to record user's meals and their nutritional facts, thus helping them achieve their health goal.

In this repository, I have uploaded the main app components, along with the backend script, the slide deck in which we presented our mobile app to a professional audience, as well as a recording demonstrating our app.
